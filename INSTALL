Installation instructions
-------------------------

Download a tarball from http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/releases[] or clone the tig
repository http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/tig.git[]. Documentation files are
available either in the tarballs or in the above repository in the branch named
'release'.

To install tig simply run:

	$ autoreconf
	$ ./configure
	$ make install

To install documentation run:

	$ make install-doc

If you had to install your own copy of libiconv, you'll probably want to pass
the "--with-libiconv" option to the "configure" script to tell it where to look.

The following tools and packages are needed:

`-------------------------------`----------------------------------------------
Tool				Description

				into the binary.
