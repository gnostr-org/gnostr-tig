Installation instructions
-------------------------

Download a tarball from http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/releases[] or clone the tig
repository http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/tig.git[]. Documentation files are
available either in the tarballs or in the above repository in the branch named
'release'.

To install tig simply run:

	$ make install

To install documentation run:

	$ make install-docs

Edit the Makefile if you need to configure specific compiler or linker flags.
On FreeBSD for example the c library does not support the iconv interface and
to compile tig you need to append `-L/usr/local/lib -liconv` to `LDLIBS` and
`-I/usr/local/include` to the `CFLAGS` variable.

The following tools and packages are needed:

`-------------------------------`----------------------------------------------
Tool				Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git-core			Tig is just a frontend for git.
ncurses				Be sure to also have development files \
				installed. Usually they are available in a \
				separate package ending with `-dev`.
iconv				If iconv is not provided by the c library \
				you need to change the Makefile to link it \
				into the binary.
asciidoc (>= 7.0), xmlto	For building documentation. (Optional)
