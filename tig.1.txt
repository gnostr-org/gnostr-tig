TIG(1)
======

NAME
----
tig - text-mode interface for git

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
tig [options]
tig [options] [--] [git log options]
tig [options] log  [git log options]
tig [options] diff [git diff options]
tig [options] show [git show options]
tig [options] <    [git command output]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Browse changes in a git repository. Additionally, tig(1) can also act
as a pager for output of various git commands.

When browsing repositories, tig(1) uses the underlying git commands
to present the user with various views, such as summarized commit log
and showing the commit with the log message, diffstat, and the diff.

Using tig(1) as a pager, it will display input from stdin and try
to colorize it.

OPTIONS
-------

-l::
	Start up in log view using the internal log command.

-d::
	Start up in diff view using the internal diff command.

-n[INTERVAL], --line-number[=INTERVAL]::
	Prefix line numbers in log and diff view.
	Optionally, with interval different than each line.

-b[NSPACES], --tab-size[=NSPACES]::
	Set the number of spaces tabs should be expanded to.

-v, --version::
	Show version and exit.

-h, --help::
	Show help message and exit.

\--::
	End of tig(1) options. Useful when specifying command
	options for the main view. Example:

		$ tig -- --since=1.month

log [git log options]::
	Open log view using the given git log options.

diff [git diff options]::
	Open diff view using the given git diff options.

show [git show options]::
	Open diff view using the given git show options.

[git log options]::
	tig(1) will stop the option parsing when the first
	command line parameter not starting with "-" is
	encountered. All options including this one will be
	passed to git log when loading the main view.
	This makes it possible to say:

	$ tig tag-1.0..HEAD

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
TIG_LS_REMOTE::
	Set command for retrieving all repository references. The command
	should output data in the same format as git-ls-remote(1).

TIG_DIFF_CMD::
	The command used for the diff view. By default, git show is used
	as a backend.

TIG_LOG_CMD::
	The command used for the log view. If you prefer to have both
	author and committer shown in the log view be sure to pass
	`--pretty=fuller` to git log.

TIG_MAIN_CMD::
	The command used for the main view. Note, you must always specify
	the option: `--pretty=raw` since the main view parser expects to
	read that format.

FILES
-----
'~/.tigrc'::
	User configuration file. See gitlink:tigrc[5] for examples.

'.git/config'::
	Repository config file. Read on startup with the help of
	git-repo-config(1).
