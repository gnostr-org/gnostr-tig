Features that should be explored.

 - Better text-input support.

 - When the user wants to "view" a commit, you could show from which
   branch heads and from which tags the commit is reachable, and perhaps
   which tag is the latest among the ones reachable from that commit, as
   part of the commit detail information you display on the lower pane
   (log/diff view).

 - Split sources of tig.c into multiple files.

 - Rewrite revgraph handling.

 - Color the revgraph to make it easier to follow branches. Idea by
   Dominik Vogt.

 - Commit cache: Many views use commit information and load it into
   their own custom data structure. Having the information shared would
   make it easier to do various interesting stuff across the views.
