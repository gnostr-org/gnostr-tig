Features that should be explored.
 
 - Locale support.

 - When the user wants to "view" a commit, you could show from which branch
   heads and from which tags the commit is reachable, and perhaps which tag is
   the latest among the ones reachable from that commit, as part of the commit
   detail information you display on the lower pane (log/diff view).
