BUGS
----
Known bugs and problems:

 - Proper locale support: in it's current state tig is pretty much UTF-8 only.

 - Horizontal scrolling.

 - In the gnome-terminal-emulator, the message from scrolling up one line
   when impossible followed by scrolling down one line causes corruption of
   the status line.

 - When scrolling in xterm (and uxterm) the last line in the scrolling
   direction will update slowly.
