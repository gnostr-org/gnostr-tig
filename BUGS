BUGS
----
Known bugs and problems:

 - In it's current state tig is pretty much UTF-8 only.

 - If the screen width is very small the main view can draw
   outside the current view causing bad wrapping. Same goes
   for title and status windows.

 - The cursor can wrap-around on the last line and cause the
   window to scroll.

 - The prompt doesn't work while loading.
