Release notes
=============

tig master branch
-----------------

Improvements:

 - F5 also refreshes the current view.
 - Allow line graphics to be disabled with new line-graphics option.
 - Main view: also include the reference names when searching.
 - Stage view: add stage-next action to jump to next diff chunk that can
   be staged. By default bound to '@'.
 - Configure: check for the ncurses header files.
 - Add author-width option to costumize the width of the author column.
   For example, put the following in ~/.tigrc: set author-width = 10

Bug fixes:

 - Fix regression when staging all diff chunks in a section.
 - Bind the maximize view action to 'O'; it conflicted with the
   keybinding to launch the merge tool in the status view.
 - Fix problem with $(cmd) usage in shell code. Some shells (jsh)
   installed as /bin/sh does not support it.
 - Do not show incomplete boundary commits when --no-walk is used.
 - Documentation: Rename gitlink macro to support AsciiDoc 8.2.3.

tig-0.11
--------

Incompatibilities:

 - Remove parsing of deprecated options: -g, -l, -d.
 - The first seen '--' will stop option parsing and is passed to git
   instead of breaking out of tig's option parsing.

New features:

 - Blame view; bound to 'B' by default, reachable from the command line
   and the tree, status, and stage views.
 - Blame/main view: allow display of date, author, and references to be
   toggled on/off. Bound to 'D', 'A', and 'F' respectively.
 - Add action to maximize the current view.

Improvements:

 - Show the current branch in the status view.
 - Show local/light-weight tags.

Bug fixes:

 - Fix regressions for the pager mode.
 - Fix refreshing of the index with working directory info.

tig-0.10.1
----------

Improvements:

 - Status view: detect renamed files and show them with 'R'.
 - Status view: refresh the index to avoid "empty diffs".
 - Diff view: make diff headers more verbose to include e.g. committer.
 - Configure: check for the ncursesw library.

Bug fixes:

 - Fix UTF8 handling for tag names and commit messages.
 - Fix the check for git-config(1) in configure to handle the case when
   git has been installed using a libexecdir which is not in the path.
 - Fix replacing of SYSCONFDIR when installing from released tarballs.

tig-0.10
---------

Incompatibilities:

 - Deprecate most tig specific command line options to make tig more
   compatible with gitk. The deprecated options are: -g, -l, -d, and -S.
   Use of any of them will result in a warning being printed to stderr.
   Instead of '-S', use the new 'status' subcommand.
 - Make man page building depend on DocBook XSL version >= 1.72.0.
 - Install man pages in $(prefix)/share/man.
 - Implement the cherry pick action (bound to 'C') using new support for
   running external commands. This obsoletes the TIG_CHEERY_PICK
   environment variable

New features:

 - Add support for binding keys to external commands. To bind '.' to
   running git-commit(1), add the line: "bind generic . !git commit" to
   your ~/.tigrc. Each command can have replacement string such as
   %(commit), %(head), and %(blob), which are substituted before the
   command is run.
 - Add system-wide configuration file defaulting to $(prefix)/etc/tigrc.
 - Add the environment variables TIGRC_USER and TIGRC_SYSTEM to change
   user and system-wide configuration files, respectively.

Improvements:

 - Main view: color the revision graph.
 - Main view: show boundary commits; they are marked with '^' in the
   revision graph.
 - Tree view: add tree-parent action to jump to view of the parent tree.
   Bound to ',' by default.
 - Allow the default terminal colors to be overwritten. To use black
   text on white, add the line "color default white black" to your
   ~/.tigrc.
 - Misc. documentation improvements.

Bug fixes:

 - Use git-diff-index(1) and git-diff-files(1) instead of git-diff(1) to
   avoid running external diff drivers.
 - Use --no-color when calling git-log(1).
 - Fix crash when opening mergetool for lines that are not unmerged.

tig-0.9.1
---------

Incompatibilities:

 - Make the clean rule to never remove generated documentation files.
   Use the distclean rule for accomplishing this.

New features:

 - Add support for cherry-picking commits in the main view to the
   current branch. Bound to 'C' by default.

Improvements:

 - Add support for launching git-mergetool(1) from the status view.
   Bound to 'M' by default.
 - Add support for refreshing/reloading the status view
 - Detect working trees and disable the status view when it is missing.

Bug fixes:

 - Fix iconv() checking in configure.
 - Fix editor invocation to make paths relative to the project root.
 - Fix out-of-range current line when reloading the status view.
 - Include autoconf files in the tarball generated by `make dist`.

tig-0.9
-------

New features:

 - Add bash completion script for tig (contrib/tig-completion.bash).
 - Add optional autoconf-based build infrastructure.
 - Add stage view for showing changes in the working tree and add
   support for staging individual diff chunks for commit.

Improvements:

 - Status view: allow all files in a section to be staged for commit.
 - Status view: Add support for opening files in an editor. Bound to 'e'
   by default.
 - Tree view: use a stack for remembering the lines for parent tree.
