tig-0.14

 - Tree view: avoid flickering when updating.
 - Tree view: annotate entries with commit information.
 - Tree & blob view: open any blob in an editor.

tig-0.13
--------

Incompatibilities:

   access to shell features, such as subshells and variable expansion.
   The easiest way to upgrade your configuration is to put such commands
   in a script file.

Improvements:

 - Display repository references in the sorted order: tags, heads,
   tracked remotes, remotes.

   the command line.

   rules are effective. The option was added in git version 1.5.4.

   unbound requests.

   be staged. By default bound to '@'.

Incompatibilities:

 - Deprecate most tig specific command line options to make tig more
   compatible with gitk. The deprecated options are: -g, -l, -d, and -S.

   Instead of '-S', use the new 'status' subcommand.
 - Make man page building depend on DocBook XSL version >= 1.72.0.
